# Bike-rental SQL Projcet
# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
**Level**: Beginner  
**Database**: `p1_retail_db`

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. This project is ideal for those who are starting their journey in data analysis and want to build a solid foundation in SQL.

## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

  ## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `p1_retail_db`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;

drop table if exists customer;
create table customer
(
	id		int primary key,
	name	varchar(30),
	email	varchar(50)
);

drop table if exists bike;
create table bike
(
	id					int primary key,
	model				varchar(50),
	category			varchar(50),
	price_per_hour		decimal,
	price_per_day		decimal,
	status				varchar(20)
);


drop table if exists rental;
create table rental
(
	id					int primary key,
	customer_id			int references customer(id),
	bike_id				int references bike(id),
	start_timestamp		timestamp,
	duration			int,
	total_paid			decimal
);


drop table if exists membership_type;
create table membership_type
(
	id				int primary key,
	name			varchar(50),
	description		varchar(500),
	price			decimal
);


drop table if exists membership;
create table membership
(
	id					int primary key,
	membership_type_id	int references membership_type(id),
	customer_id			int references customer(id),
	start_date			date,
	end_date			date,
	total_paid			decimal
);
```
 ### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```
